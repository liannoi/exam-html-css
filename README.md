# HTML and CSS Course

**Examination project performed by me at the STEP Computer Academy.**

As an examination paper for this course, we were offered a PNG format with a
detailed description and representation of how it should look at different
screen widths.

As a result, we had to adapt it adaptively using the familiar Bootstrap
framework. At the same time, since at that time we did not yet know JavaScript,
in this work there is not a single line of it.

Adaptability is implemented from the average display width (â‰¤768px), since then
I still could not use Chrome DevTools very well.

**I got 12/12 for work. Teacher: Vasilenko Igor Grigorevich**
